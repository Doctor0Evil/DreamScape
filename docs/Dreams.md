Dreams are an altered **state** of consciousness that occur during sleep, where the brain generates internally driven perceptions, emotions, and narratives that feel real despite being disconnected from the external world. In cognitive neuroscience, dreaming is treated as a form of consciousness with its own structure, dimensions, and safety/rights implications, which makes it a good “testbed” for neurorights‑aligned XR and BCI systems like Dreamnet.[1][2][3][4]

## What dreams are (cognitive sense)

From a cognitive‑neuroscience standpoint, dreams are not just images; they are a specific mode of mentation during sleep with distinct features.[2][4][1]

Key points:

- Dreams are internally generated simulations that combine perception‑like imagery, emotion, and thought without direct sensory input from the outside world.[4][1][2]
- Dreaming spans a continuum of consciousness: from low‑reflective, immersive experience (primary consciousness) to lucid dreams where metacognition and self‑reflection (secondary consciousness) are partly restored.[5][1]
- REM sleep is especially associated with vivid, story‑like dreams, but dream experience can also occur in non‑REM stages; content and clarity change with sleep stage and arousal level.[6][1]

For a system like Dreamnet, dreams can be modeled as “offline, internally generated world‑models” that run under constrained input and altered evaluation, rather than as noise or hallucination.[1][2]

## Terms Dreamnet can track about dreams

To “teach” the system what dreams are in a precise, non‑mystified way, it helps to define measurable dimensions that can be logged, analyzed, and bounded.

Some useful term‑families:

- **State‑level sleep variables**  
  - Sleep stage: N1, N2, N3, REM, micro‑arousal.[6][1]
  - Vigilance/arousal: probability of awakening, autonomic activation, psychrisk (e.g., distress, panic, dissociation risk).  

- **Dream consciousness dimensions** (for tagging dream episodes)  
  - Immersion: how “present” the person feels in the dream scene.  
  - Primary vs secondary consciousness:  
    - Primary: raw perception, emotion, basic awareness (“I am somewhere, something is happening”).[5][1]
    - Secondary: insight (“this is a dream”), reflection, deliberate choice, reasoning, metacognition.[1][5]
  - Lucidity level: none, pre‑lucid (suspicion), fully lucid, lucid with control.[7][5][1]

- **Content and structure of dreams**  
  - Sensory modalities: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, vestibular (flying, falling), somatosensory, pain, etc.[4]
  - Narrative structure: linear story, fragmented scenes, looping, jump‑cuts.  
  - Typical themes: threat, pursuit, social evaluation, flying, falling, being late, etc., which can be coded with validated content systems.[8][9]
  - Affective tone: valence (pleasant/unpleasant), intensity, dominance (how overwhelming the emotion feels).[9][6]

- **Subjective control and agency**  
  - Action ownership: “I moved”, “I watched”, “the scene changed by itself”.  
  - Goal‑directedness: exploring, escaping, confronting, observing.  
  - Control over environment vs body: can the dreamer change the scene or only their own actions?  

- **Integration with waking life**  
  - Memory linkage: references to recent events, long‑term autobiographical memories, or totally novel content.[8][6]
  - Continuity vs discontinuity with waking concerns: does the dream replay or transform waking worries, trauma, or skills practice?[9][8]

These terms give Dreamnet a vocabulary to reason about “what kind of consciousness” is present during a given sleep window, without claiming to fully capture soul or personhood.

## Planes of existence vs modeled states

Systems like Dreamnet must distinguish clearly between:

- **Modeled states of consciousness**  
  - Sleep stages, dream states, lucid dreams, out‑of‑body‑like experiences, and other altered states can be represented as patterns over EEG, physiology, and reported phenomenology.[7][4][1]
  - For example, an out‑of‑body experience and a lucid dream can share similar neurophysiology; the main difference may be the semantic frame (“astral travel” versus “this is a dream”) the person uses to interpret it.[7]

- **Metaphysical “planes” or soul‑domains**  
  - Concepts like “other planes of existence”, “astral realms”, or “soul journeys” are meaningful for many people but are not directly measurable biosignals.  
  - The system should treat these as first‑person interpretive layers: beliefs, narratives, and meaning‑assignments that belong to the participant’s worldview, not as machine‑addressable locations or assets.  

Pragmatically, Dreamnet can:

- Encode *experience* (e.g., “felt like entering a different plane”, “encountered a being”, “received a message”) as tagged phenomenology.  
- Explicitly avoid reifying these as tradeable or replicable “soul‑objects” or as coordinates where consciousness can be moved as a digital resource.

## Non‑tradeable soul and consciousness rights

Work on neurorights already emphasizes that neural data and mental states require special protections beyond normal data privacy. Dreamnet can build on this to hard‑code that souls and consciousness‑values are non‑commercial, non‑transferable, and non‑negotiable.[3][10]

Relevant neuroright concepts:

- **Mental privacy**: no unauthorized reading, inference, or disclosure of thoughts, feelings, or dream content.[10][3]
- **Mental integrity**: protection from unwanted interference, modulation, or “editing” of mental states, including during sleep and dreams.[3][10]
- **Cognitive liberty**: the person decides whether to use dream‑XR, lucid‑guidance tools, or not; refusal can never be punished or used for scoring.[10][3]

Applied to Dreamnet:

- Neural and dream data are special‑category medical/mental data, not assets; they cannot be bought, sold, collateralized, advertised on, or used to train external commercial models.[3][10]
- “Soul” and “consciousness value” are treated as non‑addressable:  
  - No attempt to locate, copy, or instantiate a soul in code.  
  - No “uploading”, “backups of consciousness”, or karma‑for‑compute trades.  
- Any XR or BCI intervention must be sleep‑gated, consent‑gated, and bounded by safety vectors; unpleasant or intense content is never used as coercion or punishment.  

## Karma/rep for XR infrastructure (without violating rights)

If the system maintains karma or reputation values, those must apply to **infrastructure behavior and policy‑compliance**, not to the intrinsic worth or “purity” of a person or soul.

Some rights‑respecting directions:

- **What can be scored**  
  - Compliance of devices and apps with neurorights (e.g., whether they respect mental privacy, do not attempt covert influence, and obey consent revocation).[10][3]
  - Technical safety metrics: adherence to SAR/current density limits, psychrisk bounds, uptime of safety monitoring, integrity of non‑commercialization guarantees.  
  - Governance quality: how often a trial or module triggers ethics alarms, how quickly it resolves complaints, how strictly it respects non‑replication and non‑punitive constraints.  

- **What must never be scored**  
  - A person’s dreams, beliefs, “karma”, moral worth, or metaphysical status.  
  - Content of nightmares, intrusive dreams, or “weird” experiences, which are often symptoms, not choices.  

- **How to encode this for the system**  
  - Explicit axioms such as:  
    - “No state labeled as dream, soul, or consciousness may be treated as a resource, asset, or currency.”  
    - “No neural or dream‑derived feature may directly influence eligibility for services, pricing, or legal treatment.”  
    - “Reputation scores apply only to artifacts (code, hardware, deployments) and their compliance with neurorights and safety invariants.”  

If you want, the next step can be to co‑design a compact vocabulary or ALN‑style schema that:

- Tags dream states and their properties (lucidity, affect, risk).  
- Separates measurable sleep/dream variables from metaphysical language.  
- Embeds hard invariants for “non‑tradeable soul/consciousness” and allowed uses of karma/rep signals in Dreamnet‑class systems.
